# Python-Pandas-Ecological-Data-Wrangling
This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter notebook with Python code that demonstrates the use of Python and pandas for data wrangling. The code includes functions that perform various steps of data wrangling, such as constructing a text facet, constructing a numeric cluster, and clustering a column of text entries. Additionally, there are functions for string processing, including trimming whitespace and replacing internal whitespace with a single space. Other functions may also have been written to structure the code.
 The code has been tested using ecological data, but it can be adapted to work with other types of data as well. Overall, this repository serves as a simple showcase of the potential of Python and pandas for data wrangling.
